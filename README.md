The possible returns from the 10 year, 80% stock portfolio are much less than the returns from a 30 year 60% stock portfolio, and the highest possible return for the 10 year portfolio is not enough to retire on. ## ContributorsGiselle TarabolettiUNCC FinTech Boot Camp## License MIT LicenseCopyright (c) [2021] [Giselle Taraboletti]Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
